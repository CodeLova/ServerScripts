ServerScripts
=============

Scripts that I use to configure my servers.

$ centos65stack.sh<br>
This installs Apache, MySQL, MPM-ITK, PHP, and mod_pagespeed. This secures MySQL, creates a user/pass for single domain, creates virtual host entries and folders for one domain. Your domain content will go in /home/USER/DOMAIN/public_html.
